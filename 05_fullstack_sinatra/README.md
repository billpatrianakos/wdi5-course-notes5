Before we build some full stack servers, let's review some HTTP!

## REST

Is a standard to work with APIs and other data sources.

* GET items
* GET items by an ID
* POST to CREATE a new item
* UPDATE an item by an ID
* DELETE an item by ID

We call this...

## **CRUD**

* Create
* Read
* Update
* Destroy

## HTTP Verbs

* GET - a web request that allows us to ... *GET* something
* POST - a web request to send something to POST (like Postal Service) -> sending something off!
* PUT or PATCH - a web request designed for *updating things*
* DELETE - a web request.... DESTROYSSSS!!! GODZILLA!!! ROAR

## HTTP Status Codes

* 404 - Not found
* 403 - Forbidden (aka your passwords sucks or is wrong or whatever)
* 500 - OH SH.... code or server broke!!!!
* 200 - OK - everything is good, everything loaded, f--- yeaaaa :)
