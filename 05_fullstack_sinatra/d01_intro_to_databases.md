#### QUIZ
1.  What Sinatra method lets you render Views?
2.	What is a Gemfile good for?
3.  If I didn't use `Bundler.require`, what would I have to do to load libraries (gems)?
4.  Sinatra has two built in ways to handle `404` errors - they are ____________ and ____________.
5.  Routers/Controllers dictate that to do when the user requests a _______________.

#### Why databases?

* Why indeed.
* We tried to store data in files.
* However, text files are unique to an operating system.
* If Lichard in development made changes to the text file...
* ...Kathew in accounting would need to manually update his.
* Entire jobs were dedicated to keeping files updated!
* Network sharing helped a little bit here but there was still one problem...
* If someone edited the file, someone else's changes could be lost!

#### But... why databases?

1. They are structured!
2. Data is stored into neat, organized containers that make logical sense.
3. Data can be accessed via a dedicated *query language*
4. They have their own protocol, too.
5. Databases can even be standardized and normalized.


#### Databases are Tables of Objects

* We use databases to store our objects as tables.
* These objects have attributes; in very special cases there can be abilities as well.
* Databases are great for keeping things neat and organized.


#### Tables, Rows, & Columns

* **Tables** represent a list of objects as data.
* **Rows** represent *one unique item** from this list.
* **Columns** represent **the attributes** of the object being listed.

Now, I'm going to demonstrate on the whiteboard what tables, rows, and columns represent.


#### What is a primary key?

* A **primary key** is a unique identifier.
* Each table will contain one column that is unique.
* This means that no two values in this column can ever be the same.
* These are usually the object's **id**.
* They typically *auto increment*.
* So `Lichard.id` is 1, `Kathew.id` is 2, and so forth.

#### Foreign keys connect databases

* We can also specify **foreign keys** on columns.
* These are used to link two tables together.
* Humans sometimes have cats, right?
* So the human's `cat_id` would a foreign key to the cat's `id`!

I'm going to draw this out on the board to demonstrate it.

#### Let's talk relationships

* No, not your Facebook status.
* We've talked about so far about linking things together.
* Let's think about ownership or... sharing.
* People can have one thing... such as a home, or a car.
* People can also have many things... such as pets, friends, or books.
* Things can be owned by people as well, right?
* Let's remove the word 'owned' and now call think of it as a relationship.

#### Sound familiar?

* Foreign keys are used to connect the dots here.
* They link different objects together by relationship.
* In SQL, there are a few proper ways to show relationships.
* Let's check them out

#### Relationship Statuses

*"Oh we just split up... he preferred JSON over me..."*

* One to One
* One to Many
* Many to Many

**Can you think of some examples for each type?**

#### ERD - Entity Reference Diagram

* Let's think of our tables of objects as **entities**
* When planning out a new website or system, we need to think about it.
* Who starts building a skyscraper without an architectural layout?
* We need to **plan** out our databases.
* We use **ERD**s to do this.

**Problem**: Before we can make diagrams, we need to know what type of data each column is.

#### Data Types

We'll focus on a few basic data types. They are:

* CHAR(number of characters) - `CHAR(5)`
* DATETIME is a UTC timestamp. - `DATETIME`
* DATE is a UTC data - `DATE`
* TEXT is a blob of text - `TEXT`
* BOOLEAN is **true** or **false** - `BOOLEAN`
* INTEGER .. you know what this is - `INTEGER`
* DECIMAL is basically a float - `DECIMAL`

A handout will be provided that covers all accepted data types for additional study.

#### Bringing it Together

* So we have tools to organize our data.
* Let's think about how useful this can be.
* Can you already think of how certain apps store their data?
* Can you think about how you'll store your own data?

#### ERD Lab

* Lab time! Let's break up into groups of four. We're going to discuss and build ERDs for popular website.

* Wait to be prompted to build your ERDs.

* Each group will be chosen to present **one** website on their board towards the end of this lab.
