## Bundling Your Knowledge Together

We're going to put together a project based on what you have learned this morning. This will reinforce your understanding of how to build an application. Together, we're going to build a step-by-step guide on how to get a Sinatra application put together from start to finish.

#### Subject Matter

Early on in the course we asked students to recommend places they would refer to newbies to the Chicago area. Some of you contributed to the repository here: https://github.com/ga-chicago/recommendations

Today, we're going to take that data and create an application out of it. By the end of the morning, we're going to have a fully functional API and application that lists all of the locations!
