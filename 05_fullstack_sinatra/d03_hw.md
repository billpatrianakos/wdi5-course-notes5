#### My First CRUD App

You're to create an application of your own! This can be anything you want! However, you must meet the following technical requirements:

* Migrations file should be created and tested. It should contain **three** tables.
  - account
  - 2x other things
* A simple Sinatra application that contains **three** routes.
* Each **route** must correspond to a specific model.
* You must populate each model with data using ActiveRecord!
* Each **route** must render an API that lists **all** of the rows converted to JSON.
  - `my_model.to_json` is a winner here

Get creative! You'll create this application in your `/your_name/my_first_crud/` folder.
