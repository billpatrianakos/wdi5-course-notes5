#### QUIZ
1.	What command in `psql` connects to a database?
2.	What does SQL stand for? What is it meant to do?
3.  What does `SERIAL PRIMARY KEY` do when assigned to a column?
4.  If I `INSERT` into a Table, what am I doing?
5.  If I `SELECT` in a Table, what am I doing?

#### Using Ruby to talk to databases

* Wouldn't it be nice if you could just *talk* to databases using Ruby?
* That'd make life a lot simpler, wouldn't it?
* Understanding SQL is important...
* But what if we could make our lives as developers just a little bit easier?


#### Object-relational Mapping (ORM)

* ORMs are designed to **map** databases to Objects
* Imagine having an Object that acts as translator between you and SQL!
* It is the Babel Fish of SQL!
* They really simplify development...
* ...and make our lives easier

#### Human Intention behind Active Record

#### How ORMs Work

* **ORMs** are designed to perform **transactions**.
* When a program makes a request to the database, the transaction *begins*.
* The ORM then translates the request into SQL!
* It then attempts to run the SQL query that it created...!
* It changes are made to the database **and** the query was successful the changes are **committed**.
* If the query fails... no changes are made and the transaction is **rolled back**.
* If this occurs, an error is thrown.


#### Introduction to ActiveRecord

* ActiveRecord is an ORM written in Ruby
* It was originally designed for Rails
* It has been ported to Sinatra and other languages
* It is realllllllllllllllyyyyyyyy awesome.



#### Required Gems

You need to include the following libraries in your **Gemfile**:

```ruby
gem 'pg' #postgresql
gem "sinatra-activerecord" #activerecord orm
```



#### Connecting to the Database

In your application file, you need to establish a connection to your database using ActiveRecord. We do so by calling the `establish_connection` method that ActiveRecord provides. We'll pass in the following arguments:

- `:adapter => "postgresql"`
- `:database => "your_db_name_here"`

That's it! From here on out, you can query and modify the database with ease!



#### Creating Models

* To create a model, we need to create a new file.
* The structure of the naming should be *TablenameModel.rb*
* We can then include this file using the `require('./TablenameModel')` command
* A model... is simple.
* Let's take a look at one!

#### Sample Model

```ruby

class Students < ActiveRecord::Base

end
```

**Great**, isn't it?


#### CRUD

CRUD stands for 'create', 'read', 'update' and 'destroy'. You perform these actions on tables inside of your database. Let's imagine that you have the following SQL table named *Sms*:

```
id  | message                | sender
-------------------------------------------------
1   | "Hi there!"            | "Kathew"
2   | "sup man."             | "Lichard"
3   | "Just learned Rails!"  | "Kathew"
4   | "hey you guys!"        | "Cecelious"
```


#### Create
```ruby
sms = Sms.new # create a new
sms.message = "Hi there!" # add values
sms.sender = "Kathew"
sms.save      # saves to the database
```


#### Read

**Find an object in a list of objects**

```ruby
sms = Sms.find(2) # find by id
# => sms = { id: 2, message: "sup man.", sender: "Lichard" }
sms.message
# => "sup man."
sms[:message]
# => "sup man."
```



#### Update
```ruby
sms = Sms.find(4) # find by id
sms.sender = "sms ninja" # update a value
sms.save # save to database
```



#### Destroy
```ruby
sms = Sms.find(1) # find by id
sms.destroy # delete from database
```




#### Conclusion

* Is ActiveRecord awesome?
* Yes?
* Ready to use it?



#### Lab

**Migrations** to **Models**

- We're going to create a students app based on our `dragons` database!
- We need to connect to our database!
- We need to create Models for our `Students` table!
- We need to add items using ActiveRecord!
- We need to read them via JSON!
