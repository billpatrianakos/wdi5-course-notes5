## 5.6 Tux!

Tux is a console environment for Sinatra. You can install it using:

* `gem install tux`

You also should include `pry` in your Gemfile! Then, navigate to the directory of your application (where your `config.ru` lives). Run:

* `tux`

You will now be in a terminal environment of your server. This is similar to using `pry` but you get direct console for your application.

To exit, just enter `exit`.
