## pry

We will be using the **irb** and  **pry** REPLs for learning Ruby. Install them using:

* `gem install irb`
* `gem install pry`

## Required Reading

* **Learn Ruby the Hard Way** - http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/
* Tuesday's Reading: Exercises 1-22
* Wednesday's Reading: Exercises 23-45
* Thursday's Reading: 46 through 52 (and _Next Steps_)

## Optional Reading

Below is a list of Ruby resources that we recommend checking out if you want to prior to next week. Next week, we'll cover Ruby (not Ruby on Rails) and introduce building servers. If you'd like to get a bit of a head start, here are some of your instructor's favourite reads (order of least in depth to most in depth):

* **Try Ruby** - http://tryruby.org
A brief, in-browser way to start trying Ruby!
* **Learn to Program Ruby by Chris Pine** - https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/
This is a quick, no frills introduction to Ruby.
* **Ruby Monk: Ruby Primer** - https://rubymonk.com/learning/books/1-ruby-primer
An extensive set of Ruby tutorials.

Finally, we highly highly recommend checking out Sandi Metz's **Practical Object-Oriented Ruby**. It is a short book (compared to other programming books) fantastic examples. We have two copies on our local library. Unfortunately, it is not free but it may be purchased as a digital or physical copy.

Finally: *Ruby on Rails != Ruby*. Rails is a framework written in Ruby. So no need to read Rails books (we'll cover Rails later in the course).
