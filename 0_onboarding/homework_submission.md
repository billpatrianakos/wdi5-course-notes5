## Homework Repository

All course homework will be stored in this repository:

- https://github.com/ga-students/wdi_chi_ravenclaw
- If you run into an error or problem, you may [create an issue](https://github.com/ga-students/wdi_chi_ravenclaw/issues) and we will answer it.

## Homework Submission

  1. Browse to `wdi/wdi_chi_ravenclaw`
  2. `git add .` all of your changes to the Git purgatory.
  3. `git commit -m "your commit message"` to commit your changes from the Git purgatory into your branch.
  4. `git pull upstream master` to gather any changes from the base repository
  5. `git push origin master` to push your changes to your own fork!
  6. Inside of your fork, create a new **pull request**.
  7. Submit the pull request for your instructors to check!

That's all! We will practice this workflow during class repeatedly to get you comfortable with it.

## Homework Submission Deadline

Homework must be submitted via pull request no later than Midnight CST. Any work submitted past this deadline will *not* be counted.
