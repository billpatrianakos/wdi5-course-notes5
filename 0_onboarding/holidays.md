## Student Holidays & Days Off

* **President's Day** on February 15th. *Campus is closed.*

## Ferris Bueller's Day Off

During the WDI Cohort we have a few spontaneous days to take off! These will be decided by the instructors to take off (typically after a project). These will be used at our discretion to take days off and students will be notified ahead of time (at least 48 hours). These days can also act as *snow days* in case Chicago's weather decides to throw us a curve ball.
