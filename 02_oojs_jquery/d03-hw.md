- 'Take what you have learned' - Yoda
- Tonight you need to add some form of user input to your website. This can be a game element, an interactive menu bar, etc.
- You should accomplish this by creating a component
- Use your newfound understanding of Constructors to build a blueprint for this component
- `instantiate` that component and verify that all input works
- In your `readme.md`, add a description of your UI Component's constructor and how it works
- `add`, `commit`, `push` to your repository and share the link to it in class
