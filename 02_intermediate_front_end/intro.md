# Intermediate Front-end

> Diving a little deeper into how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used to create web pages

This week we'll be getting into intermediate front-end programming. Now that you've been exposed to the fundamentals of programming and have had plenty of time to practice using JavaScript, we're going to take a short break from JavaScript and learn more about how to use HTML and CSS.

We'll still be writing and practicing plenty of JavaScript but now we're going to start focusing more on how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can all work together to render beautiful and interactive pages.
